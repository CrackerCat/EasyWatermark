機密の写真に透かしを安全かつ簡単に追加して、悪意のあるユーザーによる漏洩や使用を防ぎます。

もちろん、絵文字の作成にも適しています。
ゴースト的な効果を持つ画像透かしに対応しています。

## 特徴
### エキサイティング 👓

純粋にオフラインのローカルアプリケーション , オープンソースで見るためのコード。
縦と横の間隔を調整でき、明暗の色も自由に変更できます。
サイズや角度を自由に回転させ、文字や写真を印刷することができます。
透かしが写真全体に繰り返され、悪意のあるユーザーが消すのはちょっと大変。

### マジメに（メガネを押し上げる）

- セキュリティ:
The code is completely open source and uses a loose MIT protocol, you are free to Fork yourself to modify and remove code you think is problematic ;)
No network requests, no network request permissions, no fear of your photos being compromised. users with API >= 29 don't even need to request any permissions. (28 and below users need to apply for storage permissions to access and store photos)
And of course there are no stats, buried points or Device IDs, or even crash reporting (so if you get a crash, please share the crash info with us >_<).
We're forgoing the convenient third-party collection SDK and various stats just so you can use it with confidence. What's yours is yours.
- Layout: support for horizontal and vertical intervals between the watermark, automatically repeat the full picture.
- Style: font color, transparency, size and rotation angle can be adjusted.
- Content: Support text watermark and image watermark.

## Use
You can use it however you want. It is more suitable for situations where you need to submit a photo ID, a hand-held photo ID or a sensitive photo. Example.

Various real names in the country, uploading front and back photos of ID cards at every turn, even handheld ID photos.
Pre-project previews, samples, copyrighted or simply spoofed images
Reference text.

This photo is for xx for xxx purposes only, no other use.

You can turn down the transparency, just don't block the key information.

(For now) we can't (temporarily) prevent information from being uploaded, or even (temporarily) prevent information from being leaked, but we can reduce the value of the information being leaked.

Even if it's (probably) useless in the end, at least you can disgust the leaker a bit.

Anything you think doesn't work well is my UI restore that doesn't work, and has nothing to do with the UI draft. xD
